# karhu

This is... Well, I 'm not sure, may I call it "framework" or "scaffold", anyway,
this is some stuff for fast (how about 20-30min? True story. But of course, it looked boring without nice design)
developing typical music band site. 
It has backend that provides relevant content types (music, photos, band members info etc), and management interface. 
It also has some default templates for all content types, but they are easy overrideable with custom templates.

Backend built on Django, and new admin site (in fact, Karhu has two of them) built on Angular.


I work on it mostly for education, so, though Karhu is mostly functional (and has been used for couple of sites), 
it isnt really developer-friendly and may has some bugs. 

Also, as frontend-developer, I'm not really motivated about backend and work on it only because I have to, and that explains lack of quality.
